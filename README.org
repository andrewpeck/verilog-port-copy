#+TITLE: Verilog Port Copy

This is a half-baked module which provides a small subset of the functionality of the ~vhdl-port-*~ functions.

More functionality is planned over time but the main goal is to be able to make instantiation templates for:

- verilog --> vhdl
- verilog --> verilog
- vhdl --> vhdl
- vhdl --> verilog
